# Description
The Penny Pinching Budget Tracker allows the user to responsibly track spending habits. Permitting the user to keep accurate track of transactions, and deposits online or offline. Not missing a beat due to no connection. The convenience of being able to still enter a deposit and track an expense offline. Additionally, when back online those  offline entries are added to the Penny Pinching Budget Tracker.  
# My Task
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information.

The challenge is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once I’ve made these changes,I’ll deploy the application to Heroku.
